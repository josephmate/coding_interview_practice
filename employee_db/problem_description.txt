You are given a database with the following tables:

Company (
	companyName CHAR(30),
	id INT(4) PRIMARY KEY
)

EmployeesHired (
	id INT(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	numHired INT(4),
	fiscalQuarter INT(4) PRIMARY KEY,
	FOREIGN KEY id REFERENCES Company
)

You may make the assumption that the only possible fiscal quarters are 1 through 4.

Sample data for this schema is presented in the table belows.


        companyName  id
   Hillary Plumbing   6
  John Lawn Company   9
Dave Cookie Company   19
   Jane Electricity   3
   Edge Case          1

Id  numHired  fiscalQuarter
 3         3              3
 3         2              4
19         4              1
 6         2              1
 1         0              4

NOTE: In the original specification, they make an error: duplicated id. This
      relates to my third issue that I talk about later.

      Secondly, the test data they provide does not include the numHired > 0
      edge case, which I have appended to the tables.

      Finally, one issue that I have left unresolved. This EmployeesHired
      table makes no sense because there will be multiple rows for each
      companyId. As a result, the primary key should id and fiscalQuarter.

Part i)
Write a SQL statement that returns the names of all the companies that hired
employees in fiscal quarter 4.

Part ii)
Now, using the same schema, write a SQL statement that returns the names of all
companies that did not hire anyone in fiscal quarters 1 through 4.

Part iii)
Finally, return the names of all companies and the total number of employees that
each company hired during fiscal quarters 1 through 4.
