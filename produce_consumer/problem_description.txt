Implement a produce consumer model where there are:
- P producers
- each producer takes t_p time to produce a new task
- C consumers
- each consumer takes t_c time to finish a task
- the buffer can only hold B tasks

Build two versions:
1. using monitor and locking primatives
2. using the Java concurrency library
