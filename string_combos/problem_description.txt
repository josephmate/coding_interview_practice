Write a function that generates all the combinations of a string of all sizes. Two string
containing the same characters, are the same combination. For example, "12" and
"21" are counted as the same combination because both strings contain one '1' and
one '2'.

For example, the input "123" should produce:
1
2
3
12
13
23
123
