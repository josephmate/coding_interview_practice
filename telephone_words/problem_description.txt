Write a function that generates all the combinations of a string of all sizes. Two string
containing the same characters, are the same combination. For example, "12" and
"21" are counted as the same combination because both strings contain one '1' and
one '2'.

For example, the input "123" should produce:
1
2
3
12
13
23
123

Each individual character of the string should be treated as a unique character,
even if there are duplicates. For example "11" should produce":
1
1
11
