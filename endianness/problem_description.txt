Write a function that determines whether a computer is big-endian or little-endian.


Imagine you want to store 2 bytes integers (notated using hexadecimal) or some other multibyte datatype.
The two more common ways to store them is 'big-endian' and 'little-endian'

Suppose we want to store the decimal value 10 ( or 0xA ) into a two byte integer.

In 'little-endian', the bytes are stored from least significant byte to most significant byte.
This makes it easier to read from least significant to most significant byte.
0A 00

In 'big-endian', the bytes are stored from the most significant byte to least significant byte.
This makes is easier to compute the sign.
00 0A
