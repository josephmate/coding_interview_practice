This is my journey, preparing myself for coding interviews. My goals are:
- refresh my C++
- learn some new technologies in C++
  - unit tests
  - C++11 features
- brush up on my problem solving skills
- practice a bit of big-O

1. equals_without_comparisons: first C++ program in a while
2. find_max: simple standard library review and first unit test ever in C++ (done lots in Java)
3. linked_list: implement a linked list in C++ to review classes, header files, unit tests
4. stack_using_link_node: implement a stack using only a link_node
5. nested_list: doubley linked list structure which also has a child
6. linked_list_cycle: efficiently determine if a linked list has a cycle
7. bst: implement a binary search tree using C (not C++)
  1. inorder and preorder traversal
  2. eliminating recusion from a recusive method
8. heap: implement a heap using Java and gradle build environment
9. first_non_repeat_char: get practice with reading strings in C/C++
10. remove_chars: remove the required characters from the input string
  1. efficiently build the new string
