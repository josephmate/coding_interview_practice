You are given two rectangles, each defined by an upper left (UL) corner and a lower right (LR) corner.
Both rectangles’ edges will always be parallel to the x or y axis, as shown in Figure 11-2.
Write a function that determines whether the two rectangles overlap.
The function should return 1 if the rectangles overlap and 0 if they do not.

For convenience, you may use the following classes:

class Point {
	public int x;
	public int y;
	public Point( int x, int y ){
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}
}

class Rect {
	public Point ul;
	public Point lr;
	public Rect( Point ul, Point lr ){
		this.ul = ul;
		this.lr = lr;
	}
}

The method should take two Rect objects and return true if they overlap, false if they don’t.
