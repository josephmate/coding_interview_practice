This is my journey, preparing myself for coding interviews. My goals are:
- refresh my C++
- learn some new technologies in C++
- - unit tests
- - C++11 features
- brush up on my problem solving skills
- practice a bit of big-O

1. equals_without_comparisons: first C++ program in a while
2. find_max: simple standard library review and first unit test ever in C++ (done lots in Java)
3. linked_list: implement a linked list in C++ to review classes, header files, unit tests
4. stack_using_link_node: implement a stack using only a link_node
