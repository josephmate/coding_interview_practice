Given a phone number, compute all possible (including non-sensical) words that
can be generated from it. You can use a helper method:

  char getCharKey( int telephoneKey, int place )

which given a telephoneKey between 0-9, and a place between 1-3 returns the
corresponding character. For instance, 8,1 will return 'T'.
