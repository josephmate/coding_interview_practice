Implement a nested list using the following structure:

	struct nested_node {
		nested_node * prev;
		nested_node * next;
		nested_node * child;
		int data;
		nested_node(link_node* prev, link_node* next, int);
	};

You must be able to flatten and unflatten this list. This problem comes from the
book "Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job."

flatten:
- does not modify the children points, only the prev, next, head tail
  pointers can be modified

unflatten:
- undoes what flatten() did
