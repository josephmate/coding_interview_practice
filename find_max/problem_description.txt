Create a program that excepts a list of numbers, separated by spaces and find the max value.

I'm writing this program so that I can learn how to:
- write unit tests
- use the standard libraries
- write exceptions
- play around with some of the C++11 features like:
- - foreach loop (ie: for(auto i : values) )
- - auto keyword
