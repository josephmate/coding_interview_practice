Implement a stack using only link_nodes. This is to practice getting the
template files correct. Previously, I had separated the header and the
implementation, and this made templating difficult  because all the types to be
used with the template needed to be defined ahead of time in the implementation
file. Otherwise, the compiler would not be able to link the object file of the
implementation to the usages.

I am also using this as an opportunity to improve my Makefiles.
